  # _Opentext Fortify Ecosystem - Using fcli tools for automation_

This repository contains automation scripts created to perform custom actions to address complex customer scenarios, such as:

  ### * Running static analysis (SAST) in all command-line tools, whether in IDE command lines or any supported terminal in a friendly way (MS-DOS or UNIX).
  ### * Filtering all vulnerabilities labeled as exploitable into all scaned apps to obtain documented information and demonstrate regulatory compliance in an audit process.
  ### * Importing and exporting artifacts between different deployment environments such as FOD (SaaS deployment) and Fortify On Premises.

This repository will continue to be developed, adding more features and automation capabilities to address demanding requirements easily, quickly, and efficiently using the Fortify ecosystem.

Stay Tune,
Angel :)
